class="css-18gui3k-About"/><p>I am a Board Certified Nurse Coach with my own private practice based in upstate New York. I have been a nurse for five years at a trauma center hospital. I know what it’s like to move through incredible stress and discomfort in order to live a more aligned and healthy life. I know what it’s like to leave everything I have known to begin a new journey with an unknown outcome. I know what it’s like to endure unexpected change while also recovering my innate power. There is hope! I believe every human is WHOLE and with the right support, they too can step into the life they desire to live.<br/><br/>The past five years I spent working as a Registered Nurse at a trauma center hospital. The middle three were spent being a “healthcare hero” on the front lines of the Covid-19 pandemic. During my years as a bedside nurse, a gap in current care system grew wider the I could no longer ignore.<br/><br/>I dreamed of a <b>space</b> where individuals could have the <b>time</b> to navigate their diagnosis or family member’s. Time where connection could occur and healing could begin. Time where individuals could reflect on their health and life and be empowered to make changes through education, planning, and lifestyle accountability.<br/><br/>I began searching for a way to fulfill this strong calling and found a program that has transformed me and my work. Becoming a Nurse Coach showed me all that was possible, for my own healing and that of others! I get the honor of holding sacred <b>space</b> and slowing down<!-- --> <b>time</b> so individuals can focus on sustained behavioral change, addressing the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Together we break down barriers to your desired change, co-create action steps and keep you accountable to your goals.<br/><br/><b>Ready to experience Nurse Coaching?<!-- --> <a href="https://my.practicebetter.io/#/6238a05a7d12644fcc85267f/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="css-1o0uwnw-About">Book your free discovery call today</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="/contact" class="css-1o0uwnw-About">contact me</a>.</b><br/><br/>I am excited to get to know you, and meet you right where you are at on your health and wellness journey!</p><style data-emotion="css bdsyxc-About">.css-bdsyxc-About{clear:both;}</style><div class="css-bdsyxc-About"></div></div><style data-emotion="css 1ckgh4o-About">.css-1ckgh4o-About{width:75%;margin:80px auto;border:0.5px solid;border-color:#b682af;}</style><hr class="css-1ckgh4o-About"/><style data-emotion="css uja64s-Letter">.css-uja64s-Letter{font-family:'Bacasime Antique',serif;font-size:18px;color:#b682af;}</style><div class="css-uja64s-Letter"><style data-emotion="css 1jv6xs5-Letter">.css-1jv6xs5-Letter{float:left;width:120px;margin-right:16px;margin-bottom:16px;border-radius:16px;border:0.5px solid;border-color:#b682af;}@media (min-width: 768px){.css-1jv6xs5-Letter{width:200px;margin-right:30px;margin-bottom:30px;}}</style><img src="/static/img/photo3.jpg" alt="Heart-shaped stethoscope" class="css-1jv6xs5-Letter"/><style data-emotion="css 1vj4gpw-Letter">.css-1vj4gpw-Letter{margin-bottom:6px;}</style><p class="css-1vj4gpw-Letter">You are a well, once full, vibrant, and excited to give.</p><p class="css-1vj4gpw-Letter">But you gave so much without taking time to fill yourself back up.</p><style data-emotion="css 1ovvhc1-Letter">.css-1ovvhc1-Letter{margin-bottom:12px;}</style><p class="css-1ovvhc1-Letter">Now parched by the dry hot sun, your soul is desperate for revival.

I was 10 years post bariatric surgery and had gained back much of the weight I lost immediately following the surgery.  Just prior to meeting Shannon, I had started to get some traction with weight loss again through diet and exercise but I was beginning to realize that I needed even more support if I would be able to make the weight loss sustainable this time.  I found Shannon’s gentle but persuasive approach to getting me to connect mind, body and spirit truly transforming.  I found Shannon to be a gifted listener who was able to glean from our discussions some behaviors that were preventing me from living fully and achieving my goals.  I appreciated that we would “co-create” goals and follow-up actions (homework) that were meaningful and realistically achievable and allowed me to get some “wins” every week. This work has resulted in weight loss, but also improved my relationships with family and how I “show up” at work.  Shannon has given me some tools that will allow me to continue to achieve the goals I set for myself including sustained weight loss, and how I care for myself and others.  I would recommend Holistic Wellness Coaching with Shannon to anyone who is ready to make some changes in their life and feel like they need 1:1 support and guidance to put them on a healthy path forward.<!-- -->”</p><p class="css-1eybhlb-TestimonialCard">– <!-- -->C.D. age 57</p></div><div class="css-9l1bx9-TestimonialCard"><p class="css-1lkoumf-TestimonialCard">“<!-- -->Before I started working with Shannon, I was unable to view the transition period that I am currently going through in a positive way.

Instead of allowing my thoughts to be filled with fear and uncertainty, she helped me to identify my values and what is truly important to me to help guide my decisions going forward. Through active listening and collaborative conversations, Shannon helped me to acknowledge my inner voice. I feel that I have regained the control and confidence I need to navigate this time in my life and for that I am so grateful!

I would recommend your coaching to any young person who could use guidance, unfit/unhealthy personnel, or anyone struggling with chronic health problems.<!-- -->”</p><p class="css-1eybhlb-TestimonialCard">– <!-- -->B.S. age 26</p></div></div><style data-emotion="css devksf-Testimonials">.css-devksf-Testimonials{display:none;}@media (min-width: 768px){.css-devksf-Testimonials{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:row;-ms-flex-direction:row;flex-direction:row;gap:20px;}}</style><div class="css-devksf-Testimonials"><style data-emotion="css 1sk4c2m-TestimonialColumn">.css-1sk4c2m-TestimonialColumn{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-box-flex:1;-webkit-flex-grow:1;-ms-flex-positive:1;flex-grow:1;-webkit-flex-basis:0;-ms-flex-preferred-size:0;flex-basis:0;gap:10px;}</style><div class="css-1sk4c2m-TestimonialColumn"><div class="css-9l1bx9-TestimonialCard"><p class="css-1lkoumf-TestimonialCard">“<!-- -->Before I started working with you I felt like I was healing from depression but still stuck in a funk and not moving forward with the things I wanted to do.

These sessions helped me take all my anxieties and hopes and make a plan for improvement. I also discovered the reasons I wanted to make changes.

I was 10 years post bariatric surgery and had gained back much of the weight I lost immediately following the surgery.  Just prior to meeting Shannon, I had started to get some traction with weight loss again through diet and exercise but I was beginning to realize that I needed even more support if I would be able to make the weight loss sustainable this time.  I found Shannon’s gentle but persuasive approach to getting me to connect mind, body and spirit truly transforming.  I found Shannon to be a gifted listener who was able to glean from our discussions some behaviors that were preventing me from living fully and achieving my goals.  I appreciated that we would “co-create” goals and follow-up actions (homework) that were meaningful and realistically achievable and allowed me to get some “wins” every week. This work has resulted in weight loss, but also improved my relationships with family and how I “show up” at work.  Shannon has given me some tools that will allow me to continue to achieve the goals I set for myself including sustained weight loss, and how I care for myself and others.  I would recommend Holistic Wellness Coaching with Shannon to anyone who is ready to make some changes in their life and feel like they need 1:1 support and guidance to put them on a healthy path forward.<!-- -->”</p><p class="css-1eybhlb-TestimonialCard">– <!-- -->C.D. age 57</p></div></div><div class="css-1sk4c2m-TestimonialColumn"><div class="css-9l1bx9-TestimonialCard"><p class="css-1lkoumf-TestimonialCard">“<!-- -->In the midst of the COVID19 pandemic, I was in an ongoing battle with an autoimmune disorder and an undiagnosed immunodeficiency…our coaching sessions have helped me learn practices to reduce my stress and anxiety…I have gained more self awareness, confidence, and I am more at peace with my situation and who I am…working with her has helped me understand that even though I may have more hurdles than the average person, I can still do anything I want to with my life and feel like I am in a good place to start.<!-- -->”</p><p class="css-1eybhlb-TestimonialCard">– <!-- -->D.M. age 29</p></div><div class="css-9l1bx9-TestimonialCard"><p class="css-1lkoumf-TestimonialCard">“<!-- -->My experience working with you was refreshing and enlightening…I learned by focusing on my well being, I put myself in a good place mentally and am better equipped to handle the day to day things that life throws my way.

Working together allowed me to shift my perspective on the time that I have right now in between accomplishing something that I have been working towards for the past few years (grad school) and now trying to figure out what is next. Instead of allowing my thoughts to be filled with fear and uncertainty, she helped me to identify my values and what is truly important to me to help guide my decisions going forward. Through active listening and collaborative conversations, Shannon helped me to acknowledge my inner voice. I feel that I have regained the control and confidence I need to navigate this time in my life and for that I am so grateful!
